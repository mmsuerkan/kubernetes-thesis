## 🧠 AI Decision-Making Process

### Strategy Selection Algorithm
1. **Database Query**: Search for persistent strategies matching error type
2. **Dice Roll**: Generate random number (0.0 - 1.0)
3. **Decision Logic**: If dice_roll < 0.8 → use persistent strategy
4. **Confidence Check**: Select highest confidence strategy from database
5. **Fallback**: Use default strategy if no persistent strategies available
